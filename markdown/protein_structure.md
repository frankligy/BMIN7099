# Protein Structure

The punchline is, sequence deterimine protein structure, which in turn deterimine protein function. Everything will boil down to protein, no matter it is DNA, or RNA. Most of the time, Protein is the molecule that carries out the biological activity.

1. 3D Protein structure prediction
    * thermadynamic based model
    * template-based model
